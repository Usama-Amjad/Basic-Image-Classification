# Basic_Image_Classification
In this  project, we learned the basics of using Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and use it to solve a basic image classification problem. By the end , we  created, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model that will be able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy. We also have learned the fundamentals of neural networks, TensorFlow, and Keras.
